# RL-RockPaperScissors-Av3E
This is a Rienforcment Learning model where the agent learns to play against 3 different enemies who all have different complete preferences when choosing between rock paper and scissors. 

Note: This project is currently ongoing

The objective of this model is to train an agent that can learn/distinguish between the preferences of the different players such that the agent wins more than it loses.
